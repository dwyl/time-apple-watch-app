# time-apple-watch-app
### The app on your wrist that _keeps you on track_!
#### [Release Notes](/release-notes.md)

## _Why_?

Our "Time" project https://github.com/dwyl/time has been "_parked_"
since we started doing the "A-Team" (DWYL Agency) _full-time_ last year. <br />
see: https://github.com/dwyl/ateam-proposal (_does anyone `else` see the irony in this..._)

This is a _huge_ problem because without accurate time/task tracking
and associated _invoicing_ streamlining, we are _wasting_ lots of time
on _manual_ processes that can/should be avoided.

Things we need to _address_:

+ ensuring _all **work**_ is ***estimated before commencing***.
+ **communicating** with ***everyone***; giving the team/client a _much_ better idea of progress in the form of
a time spent vs. still available chart.
+ tracking work _while_ it's being done to avoid duplication of effort and misunderstanding.
+ having ***estimated vs actual time*** to _reflect_ on and improve during sprint retrospectives
+ automatically accounting for different _types_ of time expenditure (client meetings, requirements gathering, spikes/research, bug fixing, merge conflict resolution, etc.)
+ automatically producing invoices based on time spent (_both the freelancer and the invoice that dwyl sends to the client_)

as you can see, there are _many_ benefits to having better time management but we are forgetting the most important one:

> Focussed/disciplined approach to all work using "pomodoro" timers make _everyone **more productive**_!

Ironically, InÃªs does not have _time_ to work on building the time app
because she is (_way_) "Too Busy" doing the work of running the company!

So I propose that Sohil and I _pair_ on building an MVP of time.
Sohil will be responsible for:

+ [ ] Leading/Owning the "learn-apple-watch-development" repo
  with the objective/outcome:
  + [ ] a mini-ebook to be Sold on Amazon.
  (_everyone that contributes to the learning/repo will be listed
    as an **author** which will accelerate everything about your
    future what ever your chosen carreer!_)
+ [ ] Building an Apple Watch App Prototype given the required features
+ [ ] Keeping Nelson "accountable" for updating the dwyl/time API and getting into a useable state.
